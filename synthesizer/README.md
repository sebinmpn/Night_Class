# Analog Circuit Hands-On: Music Synthesizer

Dive into the world of analog circuits with this hands-on class! Learn to design and build a music synthesizer using op-amps.

## Task 1A: Sine Wave Generator using IC555

**Assigned to:** Thanzi

### Objective:
Build a sine wave generator using an IC555 square wave generator and an RC filter.

### Details:
- **Cutoff Frequency (Fc):** 350 Hz
- **Signal Processing Insight:**
    A square wave is composed of sine and cosine waves with various amplitudes, as described by Fourier theorem. By applying an RC filter, all high-frequency components of the square wave are attenuated, leaving only the fundamental sine wave.

### Steps:
1. Design the IC555 circuit to generate a square wave with a frequency of 350 Hz.
2. Connect the output of the IC555 to an RC low-pass filter.
3. Calculate the RC values to achieve the desired cutoff frequency of 350 Hz.
4. Verify the output waveform using an oscilloscope to ensure it resembles a sine wave.

### Expected Outcome:
A clean sine wave with a frequency of 350 Hz.


## Task 1B: Sine Wave Generator using Arduino/ESP32

**Assigned to:** Thanze

### Objective:
Build a sine wave generator using an Arduino or ESP32 to generate a square wave and an RC filter.

### Details:
- **Cutoff Frequency (Fc):** 350 Hz
- **Signal Processing Insight:**
    Similar to Task 1A, a square wave generated by the Arduino/ESP32 contains multiple frequency components. By applying an RC filter, the high-frequency components are attenuated, leaving the fundamental sine wave.

### Steps:
1. Program the Arduino or ESP32 to output a square wave with a frequency of 350 Hz.
2. Connect the output pin of the Arduino/ESP32 to an RC low-pass filter.
3. Calculate the RC values to achieve the desired cutoff frequency of 350 Hz.
4. Verify the output waveform using an oscilloscope to ensure it resembles a sine wave.

### Expected Outcome:
A clean sine wave with a frequency of 350 Hz.
